# YouTube Overlay Remover

A Firefox extension (add-on) for removing end of video overlays on YouTube videos.

# Usage 
By default, the extension is enabled. If you would like to disable it, press the **Enabled** button on the extension popup and it will disable the same. As soon as you click anywhere in the YouTube webpage, changes should become visible. If they don't and there are still overlays at the end of a video, try refreshing the webpage.

###### **Notes**: This extension only works on the YouTube website. It doesn't work on embedded videos.
